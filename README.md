## Quick Start of this Fork

 The quickest way to get started with express is to utilize the executable `express(1)` to generate an application as shown below:

    Clone the repo
    cd to bin directory

    $ express <your project name>

 Install dependencies:

    cd to your newly created project directory
    $ npm install

 Rock and Roll
